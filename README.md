## Demo
You can see a running version of the application at
[http://follow-all.herokuapp.com][demo].

[demo]: http://follow-all.herokuapp.com

## Installation
    git clone git://github.com/codeforamerica/follow-all.git
    cd follow-all
    bundle install

## Usage
Running your own instance of Follow All requires you to [register an app with
Twitter][apps] to obtain OAuth credentials. After you register your app, go to
the "Settings" tab, set a Callback URL in the "Application Type" section, and
click "Update this Twitter application's settings." It doesn't matter what the
URL is, as long as one is set.

Once you obtain credentials, substitute your consumer key and secret into the
command below. You can find your consumer key and secret in your Twitter app's
"Keys and Access Tokens" section.

    CONSUMER_KEY=abc CONSUMER_SECRET=123 rails server

## Supported Ruby Version
This library aims to support and is [tested against][travis] Ruby version 1.9.3.

If something doesn't work on this version, it should be considered a bug.

This library may inadvertently work (or seem to work) on other Ruby
implementations, however support will only be provided for the version above.

If you would like this library to support another Ruby version, you may
volunteer to be a maintainer. Being a maintainer entails making sure all tests
run and pass on that implementation. When something breaks on your
implementation, you will be personally responsible for providing patches in a
timely fashion. If critical issues for a particular implementation exist at the
time of a major release, support for that Ruby version may be dropped.
